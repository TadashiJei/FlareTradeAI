## Overview

The FlareTrade secure wallet management system provides a robust solution for managing cryptocurrency wallets within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). This ensures that sensitive wallet operations, such as private key storage and transaction signing, are protected from potential security threats.

The system leverages vTPM (virtual Trusted Platform Module) attestation to validate the integrity of the execution environment, providing users with confidence that their wallet operations are secure.

## TEE Protection

The wallet management system operates within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), which provides several security benefits:

1. **Isolated Execution**: The wallet code runs in an isolated environment, protected from the rest of the system.
2. **Memory Encryption**: All memory used by the wallet system is encrypted, preventing memory snooping attacks.
3. **Attestation**: The system can prove to remote parties that it is running legitimate, unmodified code in a secure environment.
4. **Secure Storage**: Private keys and other sensitive data are stored securely within the TEE.

## Key Features

### Secure Account Creation

The system provides secure account creation functionality, generating new Ethereum accounts with private keys that never leave the TEE unencrypted.

### Transaction Signing

Transactions are signed within the TEE, ensuring that private keys are never exposed during the signing process.

### TEE Attestation

The system includes TEE attestation capabilities, allowing users to verify that their wallet operations are being performed in a secure environment.

### Backup and Restoration

The system provides secure backup and restoration functionality, allowing users to back up their wallets without exposing their private keys.

### Integration with DeFi Protocols

The wallet management system is integrated with the FlareTrade DeFi protocol integrations, providing a seamless and secure experience for DeFi operations.

## Implementation Details

The secure wallet management system is implemented through several key components:

### SecureWalletManager

The `SecureWalletManager` class provides the core wallet management functionality:

```python
class SecureWalletManager:
    def __init__(self, web3, vtpm):
        self.web3 = web3
        self.vtpm = vtpm
        self.account = None
        self.logger = logger.bind(service="wallet_manager")

    def create_account(self):
        # Create a new account
        self.account = Account.create()
        
        # Store the private key securely in the TEE
        self.vtpm.store_key(self.account.key.hex())
        
        return self.web3.to_checksum_address(self.account.address)

    def sign_transaction(self, tx_params):
        if not self.account:
            raise ValueError("No account loaded")
        
        # Retrieve the private key from the TEE
        private_key = self.vtpm.retrieve_key()
        
        # Sign the transaction
        signed_tx = self.web3.eth.account.sign_transaction(tx_params, private_key)
        
        return signed_tx.rawTransaction

    def validate_wallet_state(self):
        # Perform attestation to validate the TEE environment
        return self.vtpm.verify_attestation()

    def backup_wallet(self):
        if not self.account:
            raise ValueError("No account loaded")
        
        # Create an encrypted backup using the TEE
        return self.vtpm.encrypt_data(self.account.key.hex())

    def restore_wallet(self, backup_data):
        # Decrypt the backup data using the TEE
        private_key = self.vtpm.decrypt_data(backup_data)
        
        # Restore the account
        self.account = Account.from_key(private_key)
        
        return self.web3.to_checksum_address(self.account.address)
```

### vTPM Integration

The system integrates with the vTPM (virtual Trusted Platform Module) to provide attestation and secure key storage:

```python
class Vtpm:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the vTPM
        # ...

    def store_key(self, key):
        # Store a key securely in the vTPM
        # ...

    def retrieve_key(self):
        # Retrieve a key from the vTPM
        # ...

    def verify_attestation(self):
        # Verify the attestation of the TEE
        # ...

    def encrypt_data(self, data):
        # Encrypt data using the vTPM
        # ...

    def decrypt_data(self, encrypted_data):
        # Decrypt data using the vTPM
        # ...
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a New Wallet

```python
from flare_ai_defai.blockchain.wallet import SecureWalletManager
from flare_ai_defai.blockchain.attestation import Vtpm

# Initialize the wallet manager
vtpm = Vtpm()
wallet_manager = SecureWalletManager(web3, vtpm)

# Create a new account
address = wallet_manager.create_account()
print(f"New account address: {address}")
```

### Signing a Transaction

```python
# Prepare transaction parameters
tx_params = {
    "from": wallet_manager.account.address,
    "to": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
    "value": web3.to_wei(1, "ether"),
    "gas": 21000,
    "gasPrice": web3.to_wei(50, "gwei"),
    "nonce": web3.eth.get_transaction_count(wallet_manager.account.address),
}

# Sign the transaction
signed_tx = wallet_manager.sign_transaction(tx_params)

# Send the signed transaction
tx_hash = web3.eth.send_raw_transaction(signed_tx)
print(f"Transaction hash: {tx_hash.hex()}")
```

### Backing Up a Wallet

```python
# Backup the wallet
backup_data = wallet_manager.backup_wallet()
print(f"Backup data: {backup_data}")

# Store the backup data securely
# ...
```

### Restoring a Wallet

```python
# Restore the wallet from backup data
address = wallet_manager.restore_wallet(backup_data)
print(f"Restored account address: {address}")
```

## Security Best Practices

When using the FlareTrade secure wallet management system, it's important to follow these security best practices:

1. **Verify Attestation**: Always verify the TEE attestation before performing sensitive wallet operations.
2. **Secure Backups**: Store wallet backups securely, preferably in multiple secure locations.
3. **Regular Verification**: Regularly verify the integrity of the TEE environment.
4. **Transaction Validation**: Always validate transactions before signing them.
5. **Limited Exposure**: Minimize the exposure of sensitive wallet operations to untrusted environments.
6. **Regular Updates**: Keep the FlareTrade system updated to benefit from the latest security improvements.
7. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Use multi-factor authentication when available.
8. **Minimal Privileges**: Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access to wallet operations.
